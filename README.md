# Master Thesis: Choroidal Segmentation and Hyperpermeability Classification

## Description
This repository contains the code and results for the master thesis titled "Choroidal Segmentation and Hyperpermeability Classification using OCT Scans." The thesis explores the development of a pipeline for accurate choroidal segmentation and automatic classification of choroidal hyperpermeability in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the segmentation models was composed using data provided by the Vitreous Macula and Retina Consultants of New York (VRMCNY) and the Nucleo Oftamologico de Almada (NOA). A total of 46 individual 15mm by 15mm OCT scans from 20 patients, both healthy and with Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR), with ages ranging from 36 to 83 from both sexes were used, with a median age of 53 years old. The following table, Table 1, contains the age and pathology distribution of the dataset collected and used in this work.

**Table 1: Distribution of pathologies and sexes of the scans used in the dataset**
| Pathology                | Male | Female |
|--------------------------|------|--------|
| CSCR NV (Neovascularized) | 2    | 1      |
| CSCR C (Chronic)          | 6    | 2      |
| PN (Pachychoroid Neovascularized) | 0 | 1      |
| PNN (Pachychoroid not vascularized) | 0 | 1      |
| Healthy                  | 4    | 3      |

The dataset used to train the models was composed of 120 OCT B-scan images manually segmented by specialists in ophthalmology from NOA. The validation/training split was 80%/20%.

## Evaluation Metrics

The challenge presented can be described as a binary semantic segmentation challenge; thus, the metrics used to assess the performance of the segmentation models were standard for such a challenge. In this work, we measured Sorensenâ€“Dice coefficient (more commonly referred to as Dice), Recall, Pixel accuracy, and Precision.

## Methods
The project is implemented in Python using the PyTorch framework for deep learning. The segmentation models, including UNET, UNET++, DRUNET, and SegResNet, are implemented and trained to accurately segment the choroidal layer from OCT scans. The SegResNet architecture emerged as the most suitable for the task.

The thickness maps are generated using the SegResNet segmentation model. The maps are then classified for the presence of choroidal hyperpermeability using a ResNet-50-based classification model. The models are trained using a dataset composed of OCT scans from various pathologies, including healthy subjects, Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) patients, and others.

## Architecture

*Figure 19: Schematic representation of the proposed architecture. The overall pipeline is divided into two components, a choroidal segmentation model and a choroidal hyperpermeability (CH) classification model. The first component intakes the three-dimensional OCT scan and through a multitude of transformations outputs an enface scan and a thickness map. The second section is trained for detecting CH using thickness maps with an ICGA scan taken to confirm the presence of ICGA and thus serving as ground truth label for training.*


## Results

| Model        | Dice Coefficient | Pixel Accuracy | Recall | Precision |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| UNET         | 93.81            | 99.04          | 94.12  | 93.77     |
| UNET++       | 93.98            | 99.05          | 94.12  | 94.07     |
| DRUNET       | 94.27            | 99.11          | 94.04  | 94.66     |
| SegResNet    | 94.36            | 99.14          | 94.19  | 94.72     |

### Classification Results

| Metric          | Value (%)  |
|-----------------|------------|
| Accuracy        | 81.25      |
| True Positives  | 62.5       |
| True Negatives  | 100.0      |
| False Positives | 0.0        |
| False Negatives | 18.75      |

## Conclusion
The SegResNet architecture showed superior performance in choroidal segmentation, leading to high-quality thickness maps. The automatic classification model achieved satisfactory overall accuracy but struggled with false negatives in positive cases. Future work could explore 3D approaches for improved accuracy and better handling of the challenging cases.
